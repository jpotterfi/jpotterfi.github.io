        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Coconut Milk (only the full fat, canned variety)</li>
                <li>Egg Yolks</li>
                <li>Maple Syrup</li>
                <li>Spices</li>
                <li>Optional: Bourbon</li>    
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine egg yolks and maple syrup.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mix together the egg yolks and maple syrup until light and fluffy, using a blender or a handheld mixer. I use a blender to whip egg yolks and maple syrup until light and fluffy because I use the blender to temper the eggs later, which cut down on dishes.</li>
                        <li>Leave the egg mixture in the blender or the mixing bowl for step three.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Heat milk.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Warm the coconut milk over medium-high heat with the cinnamon and nutmeg to let infuse the flavors.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Temper eggss into coconut milk.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Once the coconut milk is heated, slowly stream the hot coconut milk into the egg mixture, with the blender running on low or when using the mixer on a low speed.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Cook eggnog until thick.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Transfer the mixture back to the saucepan over a fine-mesh strainer to catch any lumps that may have potentially formed, and heat over medium heat until the mixture is thick and coats a wooden spoon, stirring/whisking constantly.</li>
                        <li>You know the eggnog is ready when you can run your finger down the middle of a wooden spoon and the line stays clean.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Add in vanilla and bourbon to eggnog.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Once the eggnog has cooked and thickened, remove from heat and add in vanilla extract and bourbon if using.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
